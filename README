This is a robot for tracking, and creating a local mirror of, changes to a 
mediawiki-based genealogy site.  

BACKGROUND:

Wikipedia has defined an extensible 'person' table (see: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_person), with which users can 
embed structured information a person into an unstructured, curated page about 
the person.  I have taken this same approach for my family tree site at 
jimlindstrom.com (see: 
http://jimlindstrom.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=James_Brian_Lindstrom).
The unstructured page is human-consumable reading/browsing, while the 
structured data allows me to do interesting things like plotting the migrations
of my family:

USAGE:

Invoking "./family_tree_robot.rb --reset-db --download-all" will cause the
robot to reset its internal database and then re-download all pages from the
site.  You can then leave the robot running, to sync against changes in real-
time.

Use "./print_my_ancestors.rb 'James Brian Lindstrom' > /tmp/ancestors.html" to 
dump a textual tree view of your ancestors
